__A User can see my initial repository and live demo__

### Repo

- Generate from Template
- Write initial, basic README

I did it all! ü•ö

## 1. User Story: it is all about branching
As a user of this story I would see a -b called start, where the structure of HTML meta-tags is set.

So I a created a bunch of them, mirroring the workflow of Git.

### Repo

For example, the branch **start** reflects a start... ü•ö

### HTML

I added head with all needful meta-tags.

### CSS

Nothing yet.


## 2. User Story 2: -b beginning

### Repo

The branch called **beginning*

### HTML

Added HTML structure to move on

### CSS

Nothing yet.

## 3. User Story 3: -b styling
As a user I will see a styled header and navigation menu.

### Repo

### HTML

### Repo

Styling

### HTML

Nothing. All was impecable.

### CSS

I started to style header and nav. Then I styled a bit more, and a bit more, and a bit more.
And I became, as a Vinnie-Poh who over-ate a honey: üç≥. All colors became funky. No escape.

## 5. User Story 5: added pages
On the -b pages, you could see added pages as about and services.

### Repo
